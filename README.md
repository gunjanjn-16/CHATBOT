# Chatbot Project

## Overview

This is a simple chatbot built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). 
The chatbot can understand basic greetings, farewells, and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner. 
It utilizes tokenization, lemmatization, and regular expressions to process and respond to user queries.

## Features

- Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", and "hey".
- Acknowledges farewells such as "bye" and "goodbye".
- Provides generic responses to any word input.
- Handles questions with a specific response.
- Acknowledges gratitude with appropriate replies.

## Requirements

To run this chatbot, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `nltk`
- `numpy`
  
SETUP

1. You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install nltk numpy

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/gunjanjn-16/chatbot.git

3.Navigate to the project directory:
cd chatbot

Download the necessary NLTK resources:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

Create a text file named chatbot.txt in the project directory. This file should contain the data that the chatbot will use for responses.

Run the chatbot script using Python:
chatbot.py

Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it through the command line. Type your messages, and the chatbot will respond accordingly. To exit the chat, type "bye" or "goodbye".
Code Explanation
Tokenization: The input text is split into sentences and words using NLTK's sent_tokenize and word_tokenize functions.
Lemmatization: Words are normalized using the WordNetLemmatizer to reduce them to their base or root form.
Response Generation: The chatbot uses regular expressions to match user input patterns and generate appropriate responses.
